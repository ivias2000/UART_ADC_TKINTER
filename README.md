# UART_ADC_TKINTER
This code has some important functions and features that I will mention below:

Displaying ADC data in a graph: The code is capable of receiving analog data from the microcontroller and displays this data in the form of a graph. This chart is updated dynamically by changing analog data and shows its changes to the user.

Ability to connect and disconnect: the user can establish a connection with the UART port using the "Connect" button and disconnect it with the "Disconnect" button. This feature allows the user to control the communication with the microcontroller as desired.

Not showing the buttons in certain mode: In the code of functions like connect_menu_init, some buttons are hidden by default. For example, the "toggle_Pin_btn" and "get_ADC_btn" buttons are not displayed by default and are displayed when the appropriate properties are enabled.

Selection of COM and baud rate: The user can choose the COM port and baud rate needed to communicate with the microcontroller from among the available options. Also, the code has a control so that the "Connect" button is activated only if the correct COM and baudrate are selected.

Manageability from the command line: The code has the ability to detect SIGINT signals (typically generated by Ctrl+C on the command line) so that program execution is properly terminated and resources are properly released.

These capabilities and features can help your audience to get to know the code and how it works in detail.![Screenshot 2023-08-29 133438](https://github.com/ivias2000/UART_ADC_TKINTER/assets/125237611/a2883401-d399-447a-8cdd-06fdebc53ac6)
